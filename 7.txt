Asteroid hits the philippines:

An asteroid hit Earth and burned up in the atmosphere just east of the Philippines. It was discovered by astronomers only hours before it streaked across the sky in a bright fireball, but went unseen by many on the ground as the view was obscured by cloudy weather produced by Typhoon Enteng.

The asteroid, which is estimated to be roughly 1 metre across, was spotted earlier today by the NASA-funded Catalina Sky Survey and initially given the designation CAQTDL2, before being named 2024 RW1. As predicted, the asteroid struck Earth around 1645 GMT, or 1745 London time, 1245 New York time and 0045 local time just east of the northernmost island of the Philippine archipelago. It was expected to hit at a speed of 17.6 kilometres per second, or 63,360 kilometres per hour, which Alan Fitzsimmons at Queen’s University Belfast in the UK says is about average for such objects. “Don’t be fooled by Hollywood movies where you can see the thing coming screaming through the sky and you’ve got time to run out the house, get the cat, jump in the car and drive somewhere. You don’t have the time to do that,” he says.
