Departure of Starliner:

In the unlikely event a space emergency arises on the space station in the near future, two astronauts will have to ride home without spacesuits.

Boeing's Starliner spacecraft is set to depart the International Space Station (ISS) empty no earlier than tomorrow (Sept. 6). It carried NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams up to the ISS and was expected to bring them home in Boeing-made spacesuits. But after Starliner's propulsion system acted up during docking with the ISS June 6, NASA eventually concluded that putting the astronauts on board for a return would be too much of a risk.

For a few weeks, a SpaceX spacecraft that flew the Crew-8 mission to the ISS will be the emergency vehicle available for Williams and Wilmore if the orbiting complex needs evacuation. But the Starliner suits are not compatible with SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, NASA commercial crew manager Steve Stich told reporters during a teleconference yesterday (Sept. 6). "So in a temporary situation, we would not have suits for Butch and Suni on Dragon," he explained.
