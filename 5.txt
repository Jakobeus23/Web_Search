Solar Eclipse's ring of fire:

Coming off the excitement of last April's Great North American Eclipse of the sun, many have asked when the next solar eclipse will take place. The answer to that question is Tuesday, Oct. 2, when an annular eclipse takes place. 

This is the type of solar eclipse where the moon is a little too distant from Earth to cover the sun completely, leaving a ring of sunlight shining around the moon's silhouette; think of it as a "penny on nickel effect" with the penny representing the moon and the nickel the sun. 

You may recall that last year, on Oct. 14 just such an eclipse swept across parts of the western and southern United States, as well as the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, Central America, southern Colombia and northern Brazil. Millions of people who lived within the path of annularity were able to watch (weather conditions permitting) as the sun morphed into a spectacular "ring of fire" for more than 5 minutes.

But for this upcoming annular solar eclipse on Oct. 2, things are going to be quite different. Unlike last year, where the path of the annular phase of the eclipse passed over many accessible population centers, to catch a view of this year's solar ring will prove to be quite a bit of a challenge.
